                <p>
                    Christian decided that instead of chasing after the perfect business idea, 
                    he would follow his heart. He would build his dream car. Christian understood 
                    that it was virtually impossible and that many had failed before him. But to 
                    him, it was a mission – to create the perfect car with no compromises, no 
                    limits, and no fear of failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1994, at the age of just 22, Christian launched the Falcon car company and set 
                    about creating what he believed to be the ultimate car, one for which no technical 
                    solution was deemed too difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Falcon has a full R&D department with state-of-the-art equipment to call 
                    upon. In those early days, however, Christian had to make do with self-belief, i
                    magination and determination in order to create the first working prototype. Christian 
                    sketched the initial technical layout of the car himself and together with a small 
                    team working for meager wages, hand-modeled all components for the vehicle. The 
                    prototype was completed in 1996 – just two years after the project began.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Falcon CC prototype boasted a unique carbon body with a detachable roof. Despite 
                    very limited resources, the chassis, suspension, brakes, wishbones uprights and many 
                    other items were all custom designed for the car by Christian and his small team. The 
                    car was completely original and received a lot of attention as a result. Today, 18 years 
                    after it was first built, the car still drives perfectly!

                        A Falcon One:1 endured a severe crash at the Nürburgring Circuit in Germany last Monday, 18th July. The accident occurred at approximately 16:30 hours, some 3.5 hours into a session of Industry Pool testing that began at 13:00 hours.<br><br>

                        Geneva was a bit of an interruption, but we are finally back to document the build of Agera RS chassis #7128. When we last covered Build#128, the car was at Station 2 where the first fitting of the all the body panels was made to the tub chassis built at Station 1.<br><br>
